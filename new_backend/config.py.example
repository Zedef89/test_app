# new_backend/config.py.example
# This is an example configuration file.
# Copy this file to config.py and fill in your actual configuration details.

# Database Configuration
DB_HOST = "localhost"  # e.g., "localhost" or IP address of your DB server
DB_USER = "your_db_user" # Your MySQL username
DB_PASSWORD = "your_db_password" # Your MySQL password
DB_NAME = "your_db_name" # The name of the database to use

# For JWT (if you choose to implement JWT-based tokens in auth_utils.py)
# SECRET_KEY = "your-super-secret-jwt-key"  # A strong, random key for signing JWTs
# ALGORITHM = "HS256"  # The algorithm used for JWT signing
# ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES = 30  # How long access tokens are valid

# PayPal Configuration (Mocked for now, as per paypal_utils.py)
# For real PayPal integration, you would get these from your PayPal Developer account.
PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID = "your_paypal_client_id_placeholder" # Your PayPal App Client ID
PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET = "your_paypal_client_secret_placeholder" # Your PayPal App Client Secret
PAYPAL_MODE = "sandbox"  # "sandbox" for testing, "live" for production

# Application Base URL (for constructing redirect URLs for PayPal, etc.)
# This should be the URL where your frontend is accessible if separate,
# or where the backend is served if they are on the same domain.
APP_BASE_URL = "http://localhost:3000" # Example: Frontend running on port 3000, or http://localhost:8000 if frontend served by FastAPI/same domain

# Paths for PayPal Redirects (these are paths on your frontend application)
# The full URL will be constructed as: APP_BASE_URL + PAYPAL_RETURN_URL_PATH + "?internal_transaction_id=..."
PAYPAL_RETURN_URL_PATH = "/payment-success"  # e.g., results in http://localhost:3000/payment-success
PAYPAL_CANCEL_URL_PATH = "/payment-cancelled" # e.g., results in http://localhost:3000/payment-cancelled

# Other application settings can be added here
# For example:
# API_KEY = "your_external_service_api_key"
# DEFAULT_ITEMS_PER_PAGE = 20
